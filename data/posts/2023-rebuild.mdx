It's been around 3 years since I last updated this site. A recent long-haul
flight was the perfect opportunity for me to make a start on it. A weekend
self-isolating with COVID gave me the opportunity to finish it.

## Better styling

This site previously used CSS modules. For this rebuild I decided to reach for
[Panda](https://panda-css.com/). I liked the similarity in syntax to
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), but with the added benefits of better type
safety, less runtime overhead, and the ability to compose style
[recipes](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes) without coupling them to
a React component.

## Easier to write

Content like this post is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and managed by
[ContentLayer](https://contentlayer.dev/). In a previous iteration of this site,
I used custom scripts to convert MDX to

- [readingTime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) allows me to add a
  "2 min read" estimate to the top of each post.

## More type-safe

A few years ago I cared a lot less about type-safety than I do now. In this
refresh I added some missing type-coverage, and added a few libraries to help:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type-safety.
- [next-type-safe-routes](#) for type-safety.
