# Writing Next.js pages with MDX

## Getting started

1. Update your `next.config.js` to use the
   [official MDX plugin for Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx).
   Your `next.config.js` should look _something like_:

   ```tsx
   const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()
   module.exports = withMDX({ pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'] })
   ```

2. Create an `.mdx` file within your `pages/` directory. For example, I wrote my
   about page as
   [about.mdx](https://github.com/smhutch/smhutch/blob/main/pages/about.mdx).
