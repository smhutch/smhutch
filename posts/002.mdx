Working on a modern JavaScript application, it's likely you will have automated
checks in place. Before merging, these checks typically all need to pass. They
may include:

- Lint rules, enforced with [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) checks
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatting
- Unit tests

We often run these automated checks during CI. While this avoids problematic
code from being merged, it sometimes takes a while to run. To help with this,
engineers may manually run scripts before pushing their code. This guide will
outline how to automate these checks, and how to keep them running fast.

## Setting up pre-commit hooks

[Pre-commit hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) are scripts
which run before `git commit` runs. The easiest way to set up pre-commit hooks
in a JavaScript project, is to use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky).

First, follow the
[Husky installation guide](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=install). This
makes us easy to run scripts during the pre-commit stage. To run `eslint`, for
example, we can add the following to `package.json`:

```json:package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "eslint . --ext .js,.ts,.tsx"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we're running `eslint` on the entire code base. But in most
cases, we're only committing changes to a few files at a time. Let's only check
what we need to.

## Limiting checks to staged files

[`lint-staged`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) allows us to run
checks only on the files we're committing. To configure it, run
`yarn add --dev lint-staged`, then update our husky settings to use
`lint-staged`:

```json:package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged --relative"
    }
  }
}
```

To configure `lint-staged`, add a `lint-staged.config.js` file. This file should
export an object, where each key is a glob pattern, and each value describes the
scripts to run on files which match the pattern. For example:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,ts,tsx}': 'eslint . --ext .js,.ts,.tsx',
}
```

Now, `lint-staged` will run `eslint` when any `.js`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file is
committed. This is a little better than before, but we're still linting more
than we need to. Thankfully, `lint-staged` gives us a way to run checks on only
committed files. To configure this, we need to update our exported configuration
to export a function:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,ts,tsx}': (filenames) =>
    `yarn eslint ${filenames.join(' ')} --quiet --fix`,
}
```

The `filenames` argument in this example is an array of strings which match the
glob pattern of `*.{js,ts,tsx}`. We use this array of strings to tell `eslint`
to run only on the files we pass as a CLI argument. In my case, I also passed
the `--quiet` flag to ignore warnings, and the `--fix` flag to automatically fix
errors where possible.

Now, `eslint` will only run on the files being committed. ðŸŽ‰

To wrap up, I'll share some examples of how to run additional checks via
`lint-staged`.

### Running prettier on stagedÂ files

If you already integrate
[`prettier` with `eslint`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html),
there's nothing else to do here.

If you use the `prettier` CLI, update your `lint-staged` configuration to first
run `eslint`, then `prettier`:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,ts,tsx}': (filenames) => [
    `yarn eslint ${filenames.join(' ')} --quiet --fix`,
    `yarn prettier ${filenames.join(' ')} --write`,
  ],
}
```

### Running related Jest tests

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) supports a
[`--findRelatedTests`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--findrelatedtests-spaceseparatedlistofsourcefiles)
filter flag in their CLI. We can use this to only run tests related to changed
files. For example:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,ts,tsx}': (filenames) => [
    `yarn eslint ${filenames.join(' ')} --quiet --fix`,
    `yarn jest --findRelatedTests ${filenames.join(' ')}`,
  ],
}
```

### Running TypeScript checks

Unlike `jest` and `eslint`, we can only run TypeScript checks on the entire
project. To run this check when any TypeScript files changed, add:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,ts,tsx}': (filenames) =>
    `yarn eslint ${filenames.join(' ')} --quiet --fix`,
  '*.{ts,tsx}': 'yarn tsc --noEmit',
}
```

### Skipping automated checks

Sometimes we want to commit code without automated checks. To do so, run:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## Summary

1. Use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to make it easy to manage git
   hooks.
2. Use [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) to access the
   files being committed.
3. Use a `lint-staged.config.js` to run relevant automated checks only committed
   files.
