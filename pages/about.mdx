# About

I’m a self-taught JavaScript Engineer, with a background in product design. I
studied International Business Management at University, before working in
design roles at two early-stage startups.

For the last four years I have worked remotely as a Senior Software Engineer. I
currently specialize in building UI’s in React. I focus on:

- Planning API’s and styling abstractions.
- Documenting component patterns and guidelines.
- Building interactive component playgrounds.
- Designing accessible, testable, semantic UIs.
