# About

I&apos;m a self-taught JavaScript Engineer, with a background in
product design. I studied International Business Management at
University, before working in design roles at two early-stage
startups.

For the last two years I have worked remotely as a Senior Software
Engineer and Team Lead at Sticker Mule.

I currently specialize in building UI's in React. I focus on:

- Planning API&apos;s and styling abstractions.
- Documenting and highlighting best-practices.
- Building interactive component playgrounds.
- Designing accessible, testable, semantic UI elements.
