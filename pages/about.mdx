# About

I&apos;m a self-taught JavaScript Engineer, with a background in
product design. I studied International Business Management at
University, before working in Product/Web Design roles at two
early-stage startups.

For the past two years I have worked remotely in Senior Software
Engineer and Team Lead positions at Sticker Mule.

I currently specialize in building UI's in React, with a concern for:

- Planning API&apos;s and styling abstractions.
- Documenting and highlighting best-practices.
- Building and using interactive component playgrounds.
- Designing accessible, testable, semantic UI elements.
